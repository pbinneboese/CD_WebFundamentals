Forgotten what it's like to rest
Life's become a constant test!

Wanting bad to see my wife
But Coding Dojo ate my life!

HT--ML
Can be--real hell!

Fools may--fail it!
But we-- nail it!!!

Boot Camp ain't no time to play
Life is for another day!

Being raked across the coals
Coding Dojo claimed our souls!

Python--CSS
Django--brain distress!

Fools may--fail it!
But we-- nail it!!!

Can't remember how to sleep

Homework piles are getting deep!

Algorithms all I see
The Dojo's taken over me!

HT--ML
Can be--real hell!

Fools may--fail it!
But we-- nail it!!!

We're not just a bunch of freaks
We're the Dojo's power geeks!

Living, breathing code all day
That's the coding Dojo way!
